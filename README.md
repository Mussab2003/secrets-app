<h1>Secrets App</h1>
<p>This project is a secure web application built on Node.js and Express, integrating PostgreSQL for data storage, EJS for templating, and utilizing the passport package for authentication via both local registration and Google OAuth. User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before being saved to the database, ensuring their security. Once authenticated, users can securely store and view their secrets within the application. The application not only provides a seamless user experience through OAuth integration but also prioritizes data security through password encryption and secure data handling practices, making it a robust solution for managing and sharing sensitive information online.</p>
